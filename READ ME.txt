1. CONTEXT AND DATA AVAILABILITY
All scripts presented here were used to compute results from the PhD thesis by Magali SABINO (2021) entitled "Bioaccumulation of trace elements in Seychelles marine food webs".
The data used in these scripts are available from Nathalie BODIN (natbod@gmail.com) on reasonable request.



2. SCRIPTS STRUCTURE
Scripts are organised by chapter, with one script for each chapter of the thesis.

The script "0_database_creation" is used to import, clean, organise and pre-treat the data frame containing all samples analysed during the PhD and used in data treatments. Then, in each script of each chapter, a subset of this database is used, with only the samples of interest.
